👋 Hi, I’m Franjo

🧠 I'm interested in psychiatric disorders: OCD, Tourette's, eating disorders, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

🧬 I look at common, rare, and structural variants to better understand psychiatric disorders.

🧮 I am particularly interested in leveraging statistics and epidemiology to devise novel methodologies to integrate behavioral, sociocultural, and genomic data.

🖥️ Coding in Python, R, Bash, and Cpp.

👀 I’m open to conversations and collaborations.
